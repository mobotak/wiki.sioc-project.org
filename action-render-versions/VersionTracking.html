<p>This page describes different options how to express information about different revisions of the same post in ["SIOC"]. 
</p><p>You are very welcome to discuss pros/cons and add more suggestions.

<p>Present solution:
</p>
<pre> sioc:Post has properties sioc:previous_version,&nbsp;:next_version for linking versions and sioc:has_modifier (inverse =&nbsp;:modifier_of) for indicating who performed the changes.
</pre>
<hr />
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Option_1:_previous_.2F_next_version"> Option 1: previous_ / next_version </span></h2>
<p>If previous / next are transitive properties, and using created_at and has_creator /has_modifier for each versionned Post, I think we can get all relevant information about versions of the data. Yet, a version_comment attribute could be added to sioc:Post, so that each post may have a short description about its revision (eg: "initial version", "typo..." as we can do in some wikis, or in CVS). - AlexandrePassant
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Option_2:_versioning_via_events"> Option 2: versioning via events </span></h2>
<p>Define events for post creation/modification/deletion (sioc:CreationEvent, ...). Let these events point to sioc:Post (part concept of post as a whole) and have properties describing the change. 
</p><p>This is similar to the wikis model - each event could describe 'diffs' between versions.

</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Option_3:_new_version_class"> Option 3: new version class </span></h2>
<p>Define sioc:Version or sioc:Revision objects that contain information about a particular revision. Have a property that described parent-child relationships between sioc:Posts and sioc:Revisions.
</p><p>Modification: combine with option #2 - have events act as a link between revisions and parent post concept.
</p><p>Pros: more precise model  <a href="http://wiki.sioc-project.org/index.php?title=BR&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="BR (page does not exist)">BR</a>
Cons: add complexity
