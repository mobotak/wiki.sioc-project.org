<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="The_usage_of_emerging_SSW_data.2C_such_as_the_forthcoming_RDFa_support_in_Drupal_7"> The usage of emerging SSW data, such as the forthcoming RDFa support in Drupal 7 </span></h3>
<p>Suggested by John Breslin.  Discuss the required providers of SSW data, and how we can show cool demonstrators for this to search engines that can easily make use of it such as SearchMonkey or Rich Snippets.  What other large providers of SSW data should we be looking at and is it important or a problem that this may need to be provided in RDFa?
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Evaluation_methods_for_the_Social_Semantic_Web"> Evaluation methods for the Social Semantic Web </span></h3>
<p>Suggested by Sofia Angeletou. How to evaluate the improvement in Social Web by the use of Semantics? What makes a good SSW application and what concrete criteria should be used to deside this?
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Aligning_social_semantic_models_of_user_profiles_and_activity"> Aligning social semantic models of user profiles and activity </span></h3>
<p>Suggested by Srikanth.
</p><p>We have various social models based on FOAF (on top of OWL/RDF), and various people create their own extensions or user models to model things like online activity, recommendations, etc. But how does information expressed in OWL/RDF align to sociological aspects of these profiles (what are the semantics of user models and how can they be aligned?).  How can we make these models interoperable?   A lot of work has already been done on (automatically) aligning models.  How can this be extended to include mappings between user model fields that may not be exactly the same?  Can we add in some social / contextual understanding?
