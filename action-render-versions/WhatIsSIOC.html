<p>SIOC [pron. as <i>shock</i>] is a project for Semantically Interlinked Online Communities.
</p><p>It allows the description of information contained within online community sites (blogs, forums, wikis, ...) and by doing so make it possible to connect these sites together, forming a Social Web of Data. 
</p><p>By "describe information" we mean to express information in a form useable by computer tools, while preserving the meaning or semantic of the concepts of online community sites. Examples of these concepts are classes of objects like "<i>Forum posts</i>" and relations between them like "Post A is <i>a reply_to</i> post B".
</p><p>SIOC is:
</p>
<pre># Built with online communities in mind. It has all the types of objects and relations between them needed to express information in forums, blogs and wikis.
# ... generic - can connect different types of content.
</pre>
<p>Examples of answers to questions that can be expressed by SIOC:
</p>
<pre># find all the comments created by Person P1
# find all the replies to Post A
# ...
</pre>

<p>To detect the presence of SIOC RDF data on web pages you may use Semantic Radar - it is a Mozilla/Firefox extension that detects links to SIOC, FOAF and generic RDF and RDFa data (via auto-discovery information) and displays status bar icons. Clicking on an icon will allow you to browse the corresponding RDF data.
</p><p>You can also download collected RDF pages with SIOC data <a href="http://wiki.sioc-project.org/index.php/Data" title="Data">here</a>. We provide e. g. millions of pages from <a href="http://boards.ie" class="external text" rel="nofollow">boards.ie</a>.
