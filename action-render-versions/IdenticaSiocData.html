<p>Identi.ca is using SIOC which is great news. But there are some minor issues w. how SIOC is used in it which is this page about.
</p><p>Describe here the issues and solutions for identi.ca SIOC data (e.g. contained in its RSS feeds).
</p>
<ol><li> A sioc:Site is linked to a sioc:Container (the feed) with sioc:container_of when actually it should use sioc:space_of.
</li><li> The creator of a post in their feed linked to via sioc:has_creator is a foaf:Person - as you can see when dereferencing the given URI which leads to the FOAF profile <s>(with a 302, which should probably be changed to 303)</s>. They don't really give their user accounts any URIs so maybe they should link to the person via foaf:maker or dcterms:creator (although they already use dc:creator for a textual label of the creator so foaf:maker is probably better to avoid confusion).
</li><li> sioct:MicroblogPost is being used as a property to link from the feed's rdf:Seq to its items. Rather rdf:li should be used as the property here. Then, in the item descriptions, they could use &lt;rdf:type rdf:resource="<a href="http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#MicroblogPost" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://rdfs.org/sioc/types#MicroblogPost</a>"/&gt;
</li><li> there is an inconsistency between type of <a href="http://identi.ca/user/*" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://identi.ca/user/*</a> resources in identi.ca info: RSS 1.0 feed of a user defines these URIs as sioc:Users (which is a subclass of foaf:OnlineAccount) while the FOAF file for a user defines the same URI as being a foaf:Person (e.g. see <a href="http://identi.ca/jasonjones/foaf" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://identi.ca/jasonjones/foaf</a> vs. <a href="http://identi.ca/jasonjones/rss" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://identi.ca/jasonjones/rss</a> ). And it's even worse for a foaf:agent that is defined as a foaf:person&nbsp;: <a href="http://identi.ca/parisweb/foaf" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://identi.ca/parisweb/foaf</a>&nbsp;: Paris-web is a organization organizing conferences.
